\chapter{Research communication}

As one of the initial nuclear research projects related to AUKUS in Australia, we plan to incorporate significant collaboration between the relevant existing international research and industrial communities.
Firstly, Rolls-Royce Submarine have agreed to join the project with a co-supervisor role, which will include routine scheduled progress update meetings as well as additional direction and expertise from industry experts in nuclear submarine materials.
As part of this partnership, I will spend 3 months in Manchester to integrate with the rich Zirconium community already there and to learn and develop skills that can be brought back to the Australian research community.
The findings of this project are directly relevant to nuclear submarine industry and will be communicated to both Rolls-Royce Submarines and relevant Australian bodies that become involved, such as the Australian Submarine Association (ASA). It will likely be necessary to follow strict intellectual property laws since the project is related to national defence. Most of the research output of this project however will be considered 'fundamental research' which can be published in the standard scientific journals as standard academic work.
