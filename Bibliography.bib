	abstract = {If variety is the spice of life, then abnormal grain growth (AGG) may be the materials processing equivalent of sriracha sauce. Abnormally growing grains can be prismatic, dendritic, or practically any shape in between. When they grow at least an order of magnitude larger than their neighbors in the matrix—a state we call extreme AGG—we can examine the abnormal/matrix interface for clues to the underlying mechanism. Simulating AGG for various formulations of the grain boundary (GB) equation of motion, we show that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy leave a characteristic fingerprint in the abnormal/matrix boundary. Except in the case of prismatic growth, the morphological signature of most reported instances of AGG is consistent with a certain degree of GB mobility variability. Open questions remain, however, concerning the mechanism by which the corresponding growth advantage is established and maintained as the GBs of abnormal grains advance through the matrix.},

The nature of the shear accommodation at grain boundaries has been assessed by evaluating the spatial distribution of dislocations and slip system activities near the boundaries and relating these observations to standard slip transfer criteria and the global state of stress. The direction of slip band propagation, and consequently the location of dislocation slip band nucleation, was determined by characterizing the slip band widths across individual grains. This assessment leads to a better understanding of the factors involved in polycrystalline deformation, including the grain boundary shear accommodation associated with both dislocation pile-ups and grain boundary dislocation nucleation. Because ECCI allows study of dislocation structures over large surface areas, and thus larger overall volumes than typically are accessible by other techniques, the overall approach allows the dislocation distribution across individual grains to be understood in terms of the broader polycrystalline constraints.},

Quantitative characterization of texture and mechanical anisotropy are emphasized leading to procedures useful to fabricators in optimizing textures for good formability as well as for acceptable in-service performance. A brief history of the development of zirconium alloys is presented followed by texture development and characterization. Mechanical anisotropy is discussed in terms of transverse contractile strain ratios from which the formability (
B parameter) is derived. Results on the effect of annealing temperature as well as test temperature on anisotropy parameters are presented. The review concludes with a brief summary of texture effects on creep, stress corrosion cracking and hydride formation. Recent advances in fuel cladding bring out the challenges in characterizing the texture and anisotropy due to Nb additions and microstructural gradients in the new Zircaloys™

The use of digital image correlation (DIC) to visualise material deformation through slip band localisation is one such emerging technique. Not only does this technique visualise the contribution of microstructure on strain heterogeneity and strain patterns at the meso-scale, it also provides valuable information for the validation and development of computational models. These experimental techniques enable the development of improved crystal plasticity models with a focus on predicting strain localisation associated with slip traces. In this study, DIC was performed on β-annealed Ti-6Al-4V to investigate the strain patterns associated with macrozones (clusters of similar orientated grains). This was done to enhance computational capability into the influence of large prior-β grains on damage accumulation through the investigation of strain localisation. Simulations using Fast Fourier Transform crystal plasticity (CP-FFT) models were also conducted on the same experimental regions of interest to assess the ability to predict strain localisation.},

Such stress heterogeneity leads to preferential sites for damage nucleation and therefore is intrinsically linked to the strength and ductility of polycrystalline metals. To date the majority of conclusions have been drawn from 2D experimental investigations at the sample surface, allowing only incomplete observations. Our purpose here is to significantly advance the understanding of such problems by providing quantitative measurements of the effects of dislocation pile up and grain boundary interactions in 3D. This is accomplished through the application of differential aperture X-ray Laue micro-diffraction (DAXM) and high angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) techniques. Our analysis demonstrates a similar strain characterization capability between DAXM and HR-EBSD and the variation of stress intensity in 3D reveals that different parts of the same grain boundary may have different strengths in resisting slip transfer, likely due to the local grain boundary curvature.},

At a low strain level, three types of interactions were observed: blocked slip band with stress concentration; slip transfer; and blocked slip band with no stress concentration. The stress concentration induced by the blocked slip band was fitted with Eshelby’s theoretical model, from which a Hall–Petch coefficient was deduced. It was found that the Hall–Petch coefficient varies with the individual grain boundary. We investigated the geometric alignment between the slip band and various slip systems to the neighbouring grain. Stress concentration can be induced by the blocked slip band if the slip system is poorly aligned with 〈a〉 prismatic, pyramidal or basal slip systems in the neighbouring grain. Transfer of slip across the boundary occurs when there is good alignment on 〈a〉 prismatic or 〈a〉 pyramidal slip systems. Other stress-relieving mechanisms are possible when the best alignment is not with the slip system that has the lower critical resolved shear stress.},

	abstract = {During plastic deformation of engineering alloys with a hcp crystal structure, slip systems with different critical resolved shear stresses can be activated. In the case of two-phase titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V, it is well established that various a→ and c→+a→ type slip systems can be activated in the α-phase, which dominates this alloy. However, their relative likelihood is less well established particularly when comparing prismatic a→ and basal a→ slip which are known to have similar critical resolved shear stress values. By combining EBSD-based grain orientation mapping and high-resolution digital image correlation, grain specific shear strain mapping and Burgers vector direction analysis was carried out after small levels of plasticity in two differently microtextured Ti-6Al-4V samples. This enabled the different types of strain heterogeneity and strain patterns to be linked to the underlying microstructure and microtexture. The detailed analysis shows that the dominance of a particular a→ type slip mode greatly varies with the local texture and that shear strain patterns extend across many grains when soft macrozones (clusters of similarly orientated grains) are present. The work highlights that the relative displacement ratio analysis significantly improves slip trace analysis in hcp crystals by reducing the cases of ambiguous solutions and that grain neighbourhood can have a greater impact on slip system activation than Schmid factor.},

Furthermore, using analysis of the compatibility factor m’, the Schmid factor of each slip system, and the angles ϴ between slip planes, a more comprehensive understanding of the details of the mechanisms of strain transfer and heterogeneous deformation is developed. In general, the misalignment of primary slip systems on the grain boundary planes necessitates the activation of secondary accommodating slip systems close to the grain boundary area that are better aligned (higher m’ and lower ϴ) with respect to the incoming slip system across the grain boundary. Such systems have the same Burgers vector as the primary slip systems within the respective grains, but are typically on low mobility slip planes.},

Grain orientations and selected grain boundary misorientations were measured on both surfaces of the sample using electron back-scattered diffraction mapping. Most of the grains were within 15° of a cube orientation and approximately half of the grains percolated through the specimen thickness. The Luster-Morris m' parameter (that can be computed from the surface grain orientation) was used to assess the likelihood of slip transfer across boundaries. It was found that transfer across grain boundaries was rare in near-cube oriented grains, and consistently convincing evidence was only found when m' {\textgreater} 0.97, which corresponds to low-angle boundaries with {\textless}15° misorientation. This behaviour was explained by the presence of many active slip slips in near-cube oriented grains that favor self-accommodation of the grain shape to the evolving boundary conditions imposed by neighboring grains instead of promoting slip transfer across the boundary. These results indicate that the alignment between slip planes and slip directions across the boundary is not the only important metric to determine the threshold for slip transfer, as the particular details of deformation in each grain (such as the number of available slip systems) also must be considered.},

The number of twins per twinned grain increases with grain area, but twin thickness and the fraction of grains with at least one visible twin are independent of grain area. On the other hand, an analysis of twin pairs joined at a boundary indicates that grain boundary misorientation angle strongly influences twin nucleation and growth.

	abstract = {Deformation twinning is a prevalent plastic deformation mode in hexagonal close-packed (HCP) materials, such as magnesium, titanium, and zirconium, and their alloys. Experimental observations indicate that these twins occur heterogeneously across the polycrystalline microstructure during deformation. Morphological and crystallographic distribution of twins in a deformed microstructure, or the so-called twinning microstructure, significantly controls material deformation behavior, ductility, formability, and failure response. Understanding the development of the twinning microstructure at the grain scale can benefit design efforts to optimize microstructures of HCP materials for specific high-performance structural applications. This article reviews recent research efforts that aim to relate the polycrystalline microstructure with the development of its twinning microstructure through knowledge of local stress fields, specifically local stresses produced by twins and at twin/grain–boundary intersections on the formation and thickening of twins, twin transmission across grain boundaries, twin–twin junction formation, and secondary twinning.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of deformation twinning in the strain-hardening behavior of high purity, polycrystalline α-titanium in a number of different deformation modes. Constant strain rate tests were conducted on this material in simple compression, plane-strain compression and simple shear, and the true stress (σ)-true strain (ε) responses were documented. From the measured data, the strain hardening rates were numerically computed, normalized by the shear modulus (G), and plotted against both normalized stress and ε. These normalized strain hardening plots exhibited three distinct stages of strain hardening that were similar to those observed in previous studies on low stacking fault energy fcc metals (e.g. 70/30 brass) in which deformation twinning has been known to play an important role. Optical microscopy and Orientation imaging microscopy were conducted on samples deformed to different strain levels in the various deformation paths. It was found that the onset of deformation twinning correlated with a sudden increase in strain hardening rate in compression tests. The falling strain hardening rate correlated with saturation in the twin volume fraction. In shear testing a much lower rate of strain hardening was found, at all strains, and this correlated with a lower density of deformation twinning.},

	abstract = {Owing to its ability to incorporate Schmid’s law at each integration point, crystal plasticity has proven a powerful tool to simulate and predict the slip behavior at the grain level and the ensuing heterogeneous stress/strain localization and texture evolution at the macroscopic level. Unfortunately, notwithstanding substantial efforts during the last three decades, this remarkable capability has not been replicated for materials where twinning becomes a noticeable deformation mechanism, namely in the case of low-stacking fault energy cubic, orthorhombic, and hexagonal close-packed structures. The culprit lies in the widely adopted unphysical pseudo-slip approach for capturing twin formation. While the slip is diffuse, twinning is a localized event that occurs as a drastic burst of a confined number of partial twinning dislocations establishing an interface that pursues growth through a thread of perfect twinning dislocations in the sense of bicrystallography. Moreover, at earlier stages, twin nucleation may require atomic diffusion (Shuffling) and faceting, generally demanding higher stress levels not necessarily on the twin shear plane, while triaxiality at adequate sites might be needed or preferred such as lower grain boundary misorientations or other twin boundaries. Identifying a mathematical framework in the constitutive equations for capturing these twin formation sensitivities has been a daunting challenge for crystal plasticity modelers, which has stalled ameliorating the design of key hexagonal materials for futuristic climate change-related industries. This paper reviews existing approaches to incorporating twinning in crystal plasticity models, discusses their capabilities, addresses their limitations, and suggests prospective views to fill gaps. The incorporation of a new physics-based twin nucleation criterion in crystal plasticity models holds groundbreaking potential for substantial progress in the field of computational material science.},

In this paper, simulations of jerky flow in W-O interstitial solid solutions reveal three dynamic regimes emerging from the simulated strain rate-temperature space: one resembling standard solid solution strengthening, another one mimicking solute cloud formation, and a third one where dislocation/solute coevolution leads to jerky flow as a precursor of dynamic strain aging. The simulations are carried out in a stochastic framework that naturally captures rare events in a rigorous manner, providing atomistic resolution over diffusive time scales using no adjustable parameters.},

A commercially pure Ti tensile specimen was deformed up to 2.6\% strain. In-situ far-field HEDM experiments were carried out to track the evolution of crystallographic orientations, centers of masses, and stress states of 1153 grains in a material volume of 1.1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm. Predominant prismatic slip was identified in 18 grains, where the orientation change occurred primarily by rotation around the c-axis during specimen deformation. By analyzing the resolved shear stress on individual slip systems, the estimated CRSS for prismatic slip is 96 ± 18 MPa. Predominant basal slip was identified in 22 other grains, where the orientation change occurred primarily by tilting the c-axis about an axis in the basal plane. The estimated CRSS for basal slip is 127 ± 33 MPa. The ratio of CRSSbasal/CRSSprismatic is in the range of 1.7–2.1. From indirect assessment, the CRSS for pyramidal 〈c+a〉 slip is likely greater than 240 MPa. Grain size and free surface effects on the CRSS value in different grains are also examined.},

If these defects can be ?pinned? by adding alloying elements, it should be possible to create a stronger alloy. It was thought that there shouldn't be much of an interaction between screw dislocations and any alloying elements. However, Yu et al. show that for α-Ti, the profound hardening effect of oxygen is due to the strong interactions with the core of the dislocations. First-principles calculations reveal that distortion of the interstitial sites at the dislocation core creates a very strong but short-range repulsion for oxygen atoms. Science, this issue p. 635 The strengthening of titanium is due to the interaction of oxygen solutes with the core of mobile screw dislocations. Structural alloys are often strengthened through the addition of solute atoms. However, given that solute atoms interact weakly with the elastic fields of screw dislocations, it has long been accepted that solution hardening is only marginally effective in materials with mobile screw dislocations. By using transmission electron microscopy and nanomechanical characterization, we report that the intense hardening effect of dilute oxygen solutes in pure α-Ti is due to the interaction between oxygen and the core of screw dislocations that mainly glide on prismatic planes. First-principles calculations reveal that distortion of the interstitial sites at the screw dislocation core creates a very strong but short-range repulsion for oxygen that is consistent with experimental observations. These results establish a highly effective mechanism for strengthening by interstitial solutes.},

	abstract = {In this work we combine experiments and simulations to study the residual deformation state near twins in titanium at different stages of the complete twin growth process, including the twin tip: (i) far from a grain boundary, (ii) approaching a grain boundary, and (iii) intersecting with a grain boundary. High resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) was used to characterise the local residual stress state and dislocation density distributions. Schmid factors were calculated from both the global deformation state (i.e. remote loading) and local deformation state (i.e. from high angular resolution EBSD). Crystal plasticity finite element modelling was used to simulate the stress field close to twins during loading and unloading. These simulations indicate that while the magnitudes of the localized stress fields close to twin boundaries are reduced upon removing the far field load, the major features of the stress fields in these regions are dominated by accommodation of the twin and thus persist from the peak load state to the unloaded state. We find a good correlation between the active twin variant and the maximum local Schmid factor, while the external loading (i.e. global Schmid factor) plays a less important role. These findings are useful in determining which twins will grow when a sample is deformed, and this has important implications for in service performance as well as texture evolution during mechanical processing.},

	abstract = {Many two-phase alloys work-harden much faster than do pure single crystals. This is because the two phases are not equally easy to deform. One component (often dispersed as small particles) deforms less than the other, or not at all, so that gradients of deformation form with a wavelength equal to the spacing between the phases or particles. Such alloys are ?plastically non-homogeneous?, because gradients of plastic deformation are imposed by the microstructure. Dislocations are stored in them to accommodate the deformation gradients, and so allow compatible deformation of the two phases. We call these ?geometrically-necessary? dislocations to distinguish them from the ?statistically-stored? dislocations which accumulate in pure crystals during straining and are responsible for the normal 3-stage hardening. Polycrystals of pure metals are also plastically non-homogeneous. The density and arrangement of the geometrically-necessary dislocations can be calculated fairly exactly and checked by electron microscopy and x-ray techniques. The rate at which they accumulate with strain is conveniently described by the ?geometric slip distance?, a characteristic of the microstructure. Their arrangement is quite different from that of the statistically-stored dislocations, which may make them particularly susceptible to recovery effects, even at low temperatures. Geometrically-necessary dislocations control the work hardening of the specimen when their density exceeds that of the statistically-stored ones. They contribute to hardening in two ways: by acting as individual obstacles to slip, and (collectively) by creating a long-range back-stress, with wave-length equal to the particle spacing. With the exception of single-phase single crystals, almost all metals and alloys are plastically non-homogeneous to some extent. The model provides an explanation for the way in which the stress-strain curve is influenced by a dispersion of particles, and by grain size.},

In this study, HRDIC analysis was performed on materials exhibiting either more or less intense planar slip, using different software packages to highlight any issues that might arise depending on the algorithm that is used to calculate the displacements. The differences between the algorithms were investigated using frequency distributions, strain profiling and Burgers vector direction analysis to determine their significance in terms of any subsequent interpretation of the data. A dilute zirconium alloy showed maximum strain concentrations of {\textless}4.5 and similar to previous comparison studies of different software packages on optical images, little difference was observed in the resulting strain maps. However, in a more highly alloyed two-phase titanium alloy with significant planar slip and strain values of up to 20 times the applied strain, one of the algorithms had difficulty tracking the features particularly at low strains when the difference between the strain in a slip trace is markedly higher than that in the neighbouring region. The consequences of inaccurate displacement data around a slip trace region were highlighted by an incorrect prediction of the Burgers vector when using the relative displacement ratio for slip system identification.},

A new experimental setup was shown to accelerate the remodelling process and promote the formation of finer nano-scale speckles with sizes ranging 30 nm to 150 nm and of similar spacing. The effects of surface preparation on speckle morphology are discussed. The high density of speckles enabled displacement mapping with resolution of one displacement vector each 0.2 × 0.2 μm2 of surface area. It is shown that sub-micron resolution is necessary to capture the plastic deformation associated with the formation of slip bands in stainless steel, which are an important component of the deformation of these materials at the microscale.

Here, we investigate and quantify the effect of α2 precipitation on strain localisation behaviour for Ti-6Al-4V with an equiaxed microstructure using High Resolution Digital Image Correlation (HR-DIC) in combination with Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD). HR-DIC has enabled us to quantify strain localisation, which shows that at 1\% applied strain the strain heterogeneity in terms of maximum shear strain is about twice in the sample containing α2 precipitates compared to the α2-free sample. Theoretical slip trace angles for all possible slip systems were calculated using Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) orientation data and cross-correlated with experimental slip trace angles measured from nanoscale shear strain maps recorded by HR-DIC to predict the active slip domain. It has been found that while slip type activity in terms of frequency is strongly dependent on texture in respect to loading direction, the actual shear strain contribution from prismatic slip does increase significantly in the presence of α2 precipitation. This experimental observation supports previous calculations of Anti-Phase Boundary (APB) energies for α2 precipitates [1] where widely dissociated partial dislocations on the prismatic plane show a lower APB energy than the APB energy associated with shearing on the basal plane in α2.},

	abstract = {The plastic deformation of single crystal magnesium is strongly anisotropic. This gives rise to deformation incompatibilities between grains during polycrystalline deformation, which are thought to limit ductility and formability. Wrought polycrystalline magnesium alloys are far from brittle, especially in uniaxial tension, implying that these incompatibilities can be accommodated to some extent, although it is not clear how. We have used high-resolution digital image correlation (HRDIC), supported by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), to study quantitatively and at the microstructural scale the accommodation of deformation incompatibility in an AZ31 magnesium alloy. Using a new gold remodelling procedure that improves the spatial resolution to 44 nm, we quantified the deformation heterogeneity after a small stretch in uniaxial tension. Our results confirm that polycrystalline deformation is very heterogeneous, with local axial true strains at grain boundaries 32 times higher than the applied average strain of 0.027, and 18 times higher at slip bands within grains. The local and macroscopic deformation gradients are very different in character as well as magnitude. The resultant deformation incompatibility is accommodated primarily by gradients in basal slip and the activation of difficult slip in “hard” grains, giving rise to grain breakup, with a smaller contribution by enhanced grain boundary shear and twinning. These results support the idea that a homogeneous distribution of “hard” and “soft” grains can prevent the development of strain localization and, therefore, that controlling texture and microtexture is a powerful way of enhancing the formability of magnesium alloys without reducing their single crystal plastic anisotropy.},

With additional strain, but still below macroscopic yielding, pyramidal and prismatic plastic activity was observed as slip bands transmitting across many grains and entire microtextured regions (MTRs). The localization of long range plastic strain occurred within MTRs that allowed for slip transmission across grains with low angle boundaries. The rolled titanium plate material having strong [0001] and[101¯0]texture components showed pyramidal and prismatic type slip extending across entire MTRs at strains well below macroscopic yielding.

At 350°C, the kinetics of mobile dislocations becomes very jerky and inhomogeneous, in agreement with a dynamic strain aging mechanism. Above this temperature, the motion is again steady and homogeneous. Extensive cross-slip forms super-jogs which are efficient pinning points against the glide motion. These super-jogs move by glide along the Burgers vector direction, never by climb. The glide velocity between super-jogs is linear as a function of the total driving stress (applied stress minus line-tension stress due to dislocation curvature), in agreement with the solute dragging mechanism.

	abstract = {Zirconium alloys, used in the nuclear industry, are subjected to neutron irradiation that affects their mechanical properties. At the microscopic scale, neutron irradiation creates small dislocation loops that act as obstacles against dislocation glide, explaining the irradiation hardening. Transmission electron microscopy observations performed after post-irradiation mechanical tests have shown that loops are swept out by gliding dislocations, creating thin zones free of defects. Observations have proven that slip occurs preferably in the basal plane, a puzzling fact as dislocations mainly glide in the prismatic plane in unirradiated conditions. In order to understand this phenomenon, discrete dislocation dynamics (DD) simulations, on complex configurations, have been performed. The input parameters of this code have been adjusted on molecular dynamics simulations. Then interactions between loops and mixed dislocations gliding either in the prismatic or basal plane have been simulated. These simulations show that prismatic glide is always impeded in the mixed-screw direction, whereas for basal slip, clearing or a weak interaction occurs in the mixed-screw direction, allowing an easy glide of basal dislocations. Furthermore, all three basal systems can contribute to clearing in the basal plane contrary to prismatic slip. These two reasons explain the easy basal glide and clearing of loops after irradiation. Moreover, in situ straining experiments inside a transmission electron microscopy have been conducted on ion-irradiated recrystallized Zircaloy-4. Several interactions between dislocations and loops have been observed in situ. The DD code has been used to simulate these interactions. A fair agreement is obtained between simulations and experiments, showing the relevance of the DD numerical tool.},

	abstract = {Single crystal and bicrystal specimens of high-purity aluminum having controlled orientations were grown from the melt using “seeding” techniques. The crystals were similarly oriented with respect to the specimen axis which was located near 〈110〉 in the stereographic projection. The effect of varying the orientation difference, by rotations about the specimen axis, on the tensile stress-strain curves and slip characteristics was studied up to 2 per cent deformation. An increase in orientation difference was found to have a marked effect on inhibiting the initial plastic deformation and on modifying the subsequent stages of deformation. The yield stress and the rate of strain hardening increased and the “easy” glide region was shortened, as the orientation difference between neighboring crystals increased. The shortening of the “easy” glide region was related to the increased amount of double glide observed in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The operative slip planes in the bicrystal specimens were determined to be the same as those which occur for a single crystal stressed in a similar manner. The results were discussed in terms of a slip activation process and the obstruction of dislocations at the grain boundary.
Résumé
On a produit des monocristaux et des bicristaux d'aluminium de haute pureté, ayant des orientations contrôlées, par la solidification du métal liquide, en employant la technique de germination contrôlée. Les cristaux étaient orientés d'une façon similaire par rapport à l'axe de l'échantillon, qui se trouvait au voisinage de 〈110〉 dans la projection stéréographique. L'effet de variation de la différence d'orientation, produite par des rotations autour de l'axe de l'échantillon, sur les courbes tension-déformation en extension et sur les caractéristiques de glissement, fut étudiée jusqu'à une déformation de 2 pour cent. On a constaté qu'une augmentation de la différence d'orientation avait une influence marquée sur le freinage de la déformation plastique, initiale, et sur la modification des étapes ultérieures de la déformation. La tension d'écoulement et la vitesse de durcissement par déformation augmentent, et la région de glissement facile diminue, quand la différence d'orientation entre deux cristaux adjacents augmente. La diminution de la région de glissement facile était liée à l'accroissement du glissement double dans le voisinage du joint intercristallin. On a constaté que le glissement dans les bicristaux s'opérait sur les mêmes plans que le glissement dans des monocristaux déformés par une application similaire de tension. Les résultats ont été discutés en termes d'un processus d'activation de glissement et de l'obstruction des dislocations au joint intercristallin.
Zusammenfassung
Einkristall- und Bikristallproben aus Reinstaluminium mit vorgegebenen Orientierungen wurden aus der Schmelze mit Hilfe von “Keimkristallen” gezüchtet. Die Kristalle hatten in Bezug auf die Probenachse eine ähnliche Orientierung. Die Probenachse befand sich in der Nähe von 110 in der stereographischen Projektion. Bei Deformationen bis zu 2\% wurde der Effekt einer Änderung der Orientierung (durch Drehungen um die Probenachse) auf die Zugspannungs-Verzerrungskurven und auf die Gleitungserscheinungen untersucht. Es zeigte sich, dass eine Vergrösserung des Orientierungsunterschiedes einen erheblichen Einfluss auf das Unterdrücken des Anfangsstadiums der plastischen Verformung und die Modifizierung der darauffolgenden Stadien hatte. Die Fliesspannung und die Geschwindigkeit der Spannungshärtung stieg an, und der Bereich der “leichten” Gleitung verringerte sich, wenn der Orientierungsunterschied zwischen den benachbarten Kristallen vergrössert wurde. Die Verringerung des Bereichs der “leichten” Gleitung; wurde mit der Zunahme der Doppelgleitung, die in der Nähe der Korngrenzen beobachtet wurde, in Beziehung gesetzt. Die in den Bikristallen wirksamen Gleitebenen wurden bestimmt, und es zeigte sich, dass sie den in einem gleichartig verformten Einkristall auftretenden Gleitebenen entsprechen. Die Ergebnisse werden im Rahmen des Aktivierungsvorgangs der Gleitung und der an Korngrenzen erfolgenden Bewegungshinderung der Versetzungen diskutiert.},

	abstract = {Slip transfer and blocking across grain boundaries was studied in a Ti foil with a strong rolling texture deformed in tension. Prior to deformation, the shape of the grains and the orientation of the grain boundaries were quantified through laboratory scale diffraction contrast tomography (LabDCT). Mechanical deformation led to the activation of 〈a〉 prismatic slip, and slip transfer/blocking was assessed in {\textgreater} 300 grain boundaries by means of slip trace analysis and electron backscatter diffraction. A categorical model was employed to accurately assess slip transfer, and the "F1 score" of various slip transfer criteria proposed in the literature was evaluated for the first time from 3D grain boundary information. Remarkably, for the prismatic-dominated slip transfer in the current Ti sample, the results show that the best predictions of slip transfer/blocking are provided by the angle κ, which is directly related to the residual Burgers vector, and by the Luster-Morris parameter m'. In contrast, metrics based on the twist angle θ and on the LRB criterion were not able to predict accurately slip transfer/blocking. Thus, the extensive analysis of the 3D grain boundary data and the novel application of LabDCT was able to help clarify the role of grain boundary orientation on the mechanisms of plastic deformation in polycrystals with strong prismatic-dominated slip.},

Different geometrical slip transfer criteria were tested, and, in general, the slip transfer likelihood increased when the slip systems across the boundary were well-aligned. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of selected grain boundaries revealed that slip transfer could be triggered or impeded depending on the local stresses acting on the neighborhood, regardless of the alignment between the slip systems.

We compare our results with experimental data and find that they are in good agreement with the available experimental evidence. We also compare the VPSC predictions with the ones of a Full Constraints approach and observe that they differ both quantitatively and qualitatively: according with the predictions of the VPSC scheme, deformation is accommodated mostly by the soft systems, the twinning activity is much lower, and fewer systems are active, in average, per grain. These results are a consequence of having accounted for the grain interaction with its surroundings, which is a crucial aspect when modeling plastically anisotropic materials.},

In LPM, grain domain is modeled as an assembly of regularly packed material particles according to the atomic lattice. The interaction between material particles is nonlocal, e.g., for mechanical problems, a material particle interacts with neighboring material particles up to certain distance via bonds and the interaction between two material particles depends on the deformation states of not only the two material particles but also all their neighbors. To determine the nonlocal interaction between material particles, a top-down approach based on the classical continuum theories is developed. Equivalency assumptions of energy, heat transfer rate and thermal strain between LPM and its continuum counterpart are made to consistently determine the material particle interaction for mechanical, thermal, and thermal–mechanical coupling problems, respectively. To capture the crystallographic orientation, a lattice rotation scheme that is equivalent to the coordinate transformation used in the classical continuum theories is adopted. Numerical studies regarding validity of the proposed nonlocal discrete reformulation and accuracy of the model prediction are conducted for all three types of analysis. Good agreements are observed between the results from the developed reformulations and the conventional continuum theories.},

We provide a brief overview of CP and a review of the literature, which is dominated by surface observations. The motivating question asks how well does CP represent the mesoscale behavior of large populations of dislocations (as carriers of plastic strain). The literature shows consistently that only moderate agreement is found between experiment and calculation. We supplement this with a current example of microstructure evolution in the interior of a copper sample subjected to tensile deformation. Nondestructive measurements of orientation fields were performed using the near-field high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (nf-HEDM) technique at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Starting at highly ordered grains, a single two-dimensional slice of microstructure containing ?150 grains was followed through multiple strain states, where it tracked lattice rotations and defect accumulation of up to 14\% elongation. In accord with the literature, at the scale of individual grains, comparison of observations with CP models indicates reasonable qualitative agreement but significant variations between simulation and experiment are apparent. The conclusion is that in order to be able to quantify the effects of microstructure on the distributions of slip, orientation change, and damage accumulation, the empirically derived constitutive relations used in continuum-scale simulations need to be improved. Equally important will be the development of large-scale simulations of polycrystals that directly model dislocations.},

At the macroscale, interactions of dislocation channels with grain boundaries result in slip blockage, slip transmission and slip along the grain boundary with an associated in-plane displacement. At the dislocation level, slip transmission prediction is governed by the strain energy density minimization. However, the importance of the local resolved shear stress increases, in the sense that it must be of sufficient magnitude to propagate the dislocations through the damaged matrix. If this condition is not satisfied, the grain boundary will activate an alternative mechanism to relieve the strain accumulated from accommodation of lattice dislocations and the stress concentration associated with the formation of a dislocation pile-up. One observed relief mechanism involves the nucleation and propagation of a crack along the grain boundary, which is accompanied by an out-of-plane displacement of the boundary.},

So far, only the accommodation obtained through slip (and twinning) alone has been considered in the mechanism known as slip (and twin) transfer. Here, a strain transfer mechanism that also requires the rotation of the crystal lattice is demonstrated. A region of accumulated slip develops perpendicular to the active slip plane in the impinged grain. The slip gradients enable a localized lattice rotation that accommodates the shear strain in the incoming band, preventing the build-up of interfacial stresses. The mechanism operates preferentially at the boundaries between highly misoriented grains. Facilitating strain transfer at these interfaces opens up new possibilities to improve the mechanical properties of polycrystals, as discussed.},

In this work, we visualize an unprecedented 10,265 GBs in a 3D Al-Cu sample using laboratory-based X-ray diffraction tomography (LabDCT). By applying finite-size scaling with the critical exponents from standard percolation theory, we determine from our experimental data a percolation threshold of 0.236 ± 0.039 for the GBs in the thermodynamic limit. We compare our results to those from past simulations, which model the 3D microstructure using space-filling polyhedra; the thresholds show good agreement when they are normalized by the topological characteristics of the GB network. We further investigate the percolation threshold of triple junction (TJ) lines, which we show to be necessarily lower than that of the GBs. The percolation behavior of TJs is also different from that of the theoretical diamond lattice due to two factors: a surprisingly higher coordination of nodes (6.184 vs. 4) and also a spatial clustering of TJs in the microstructure. The insights obtained herein can help inform the design of failure-resistant materials via GB engineering.},

The model identification process includes the search for the relative critical resolved shear stresses (CRSS), of the slip families of the α-titanium crystal, the total CRSS introducing crystallographic texture and the hardening laws using uniaxial fatigue tests in the Rε=0 and Rε=−1 regimes. The material model is used in a 3D cylinder/plate fretting computation. The results are discussed showing the equivalent inelastic strain and the contact pressure evolution. The results show the anisotropic influence of the polycrystal material model on fretting fatigue.

	abstract = {Hydrogen embrittlement in zirconium alloys is a highly relevant research topic, important for ensuring the integrity of nuclear fuel clads. While the presence of hydrides in zirconium-based clad is a well-known risk factor due to their brittleness, the effect of the presence of hydrogen in solid solution is unclear. According to the Hydrogen Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP) model, hydrogen in solid solution may affect the mechanical performance of a metal by increasing dislocation mobility due to the shielding effect that hydrogen has on the interaction of dislocations with other types of defects. In the presented work, the presence of HELP has been assessed in Zircaloy-4 samples, under conditions relevant to the storage of spent nuclear fuel. Elevated temperature tensile tests were performed on samples containing localized areas of higher hydrogen concentration, as quantified by neutron radiography. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) analysis was performed on the specimen surfaces for quantitative characterization of strain heterogeneity during deformation to identify the regions where the plastic strain localization occurs. These regions could be correlated to elevated amounts of hydrogen in solid solution, that is, in the location immediately adjacent to dissolving hydrides, or in the areas of the samples with local hydrogen concentration close to the expected terminal solid solubility limit (TSS) in the test conditions. The results confirm the presence of localized softening caused by solid solution hydrogen, indicating that the HELP mechanism needs to be taken into account when modeling the mechanical response of zirconium-based nuclear fuel clads at elevated temperatures. © 2023 The Authors},

An electron back-scattering technique is used to collect grain orientations as a function of strain and post-strain annealing time and the results show that the proportions of coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries increase during the post-strain anneals. Most of the CSLs are potentially ?special? types and tend to occur in clusters, with an increased tendency for clustering as the end of the grain growth incubation period is approached. It is therefore proposed that special boundary clustering is instrumental in the initiation of anomalous grain growth.},

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of an annealed commercially pure Ti plate were investigated. Tension and compression tests were made at room temperature, and EBSD was used to characterize the initial and deformed microstructures. The visco-plastic self-consistent model with an empirical Voce hardening law was used to reproduce the material behavior. Several self consistent schemes (SCS) were used, and the simulated twin volume fractions, textures and plastic anisotropy (r-values) were compared with experimental data. The hardening of slip modes by twinning were taken into account by latent hardening coefficients. Only the Tangent SCS allows reproducing perfectly all the stress-strain curves, but the latent hardening for prismatic slip by tension twinning must be higher in compression than in tension. It is found that under compression, tension twinning and prismatic slip compete and impede each other, so tension twinning dramatically increases the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of all slip modes, which is modeled by a strong latent hardening. But under tension, tension twins grow in undeformed matrix and slightly increase the CRSS for prismatic slip, resulting in a low latent hardening. The Tangent SCS can also reproduce better the r-values. The deformed textures predicted by all the SCS except Secant are similar. Simulations show that the CRSS for pyramidal {\textless}c+a{\textgreater} slip is higher than the CRSS for basal slip.},

In this study, the anisotropy of the macro-mesoscopic deformation behavior of the material and its evolution with strain were systematically studied by uniaxial tensile test and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. Based on the above results, the calculation formula of Schmid factor (SF) for each variant of the slip system expressed by the crystal orientation angle was derived, and the influence of initial texture and texture redirection on the activability of each deformation mode was explored. The impact of the ratios between the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of the three deformation modes on the predictions of the dominant deformation mode of yield was systematically assessed, using the CRSS as the standard. The initial yield mode of RD tensile is prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater}slip, while TD tensile may be a combination of multiple slip modes. One of the primary reasons of the evolution of the basal split texture components is the activation of dislocation slip, while the twinning mainly plays a role in coordinating the deformation. According the Taylor axis analysis, the prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip is the primary deformation mode during RD and TD tensile, followed by pyramidal {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip, while the basal {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip is difficult to be activated or the activability decreases with the increase of strain.},

Crystallographic slip, deformation twinning and slip inside twinned regions were all considered as contributing mechanisms for the plastic strain in the model. This was accomplished by treating the dominant twin systems in a given crystal as independent grains once the total twin volume fraction in that crystal reached a predetermined saturation value. The newly formed grains were allowed to independently undergo further slip and the concomitant lattice rotation, but further twinning was prohibited. New descriptions have been established for slip and twin hardening and the complex coupling between them.

Constant strain rate tests were conducted on this material in simple compression, plane-strain compression and simple shear, and the true stress (σ)-true strain (ε) responses were documented. From the measured data, the strain hardening rates were numerically computed, normalized by the shear modulus (G), and plotted against both normalized stress and ε. These normalized strain hardening plots exhibited three distinct stages of strain hardening that were similar to those observed in previous studies on low stacking fault energy fcc metals (e.g. 70/30 brass) in which deformation twinning has been known to play an important role. Optical microscopy and Orientation imaging microscopy were conducted on samples deformed to different strain levels in the various deformation paths. It was found that the onset of deformation twinning correlated with a sudden increase in strain hardening rate in compression tests. The falling strain hardening rate correlated with saturation in the twin volume fraction. In shear testing a much lower rate of strain hardening was found, at all strains, and this correlated with a lower density of deformation twinning.},

Nilson and Petterson introduced the bomb method but they borrowed it from the current practice of reducing metal halides and oxides with alkali metals in a bolted gun barrel. Hunter just copied the Nilson-Petterson process and he was somewhat more successful. Good malleability of the titanium obtained was later achieved with this method by Lely and Hamburger. Pressureless sodium reduction was already used by Billy, before Freudenberg operated with this proposition on a large scale.

	abstract = {The mechanical behavior of a commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) is systematically investigated in quasi-static (Instron, servohydraulic) and dynamic (UCSD's recovery Hopkinson) compression. Strains over 40\% are achieved in these tests over a temperature range of 77–1000K and strain rates of 10−3–8000/s. At the macroscopic level, the flow stress of CP-Ti, within the plastic deformation regime, is strongly dependent on the temperature and strain rate, and displays complex variations with strain, strain rate, and temperature. In particular, there is a three-stage deformation pattern at a temperature range from 296 to 800K, the specific range depending on the strain rate. In an effort to understand the underlying mechanisms, a number of interrupted tests involving temperature jumps are performed, and the resulting microstructures are characterized using an optical microscope. Based on the experimental results and simple estimates, it is concluded that the three-stage pattern of deformation at temperatures from 296 to 800K, is a result of dynamic strain aging, through the directional diffusion of dislocation-core point defects with the moving dislocation at high strain rates, although the usual dynamic strain aging by point defects segregating outside the dislocation core through volume diffusion is also observed at low strain rates and high temperatures. The microscopic analysis shows that there is substantial deformation twinning which cannot be neglected in modeling the plastic flow of CP-Ti. The density of twins increases markedly with increasing strain rate, strain, and decreasing temperature. Twin intersections occur, and become more pronounced at low temperatures or high strain rates. In sum, the true stress–true strain curves of CP-Ti show two stages of deformation pattern at low temperatures, three stages at temperatures above 296K, and only one stage at temperatures exceeding 800K, although all three stages may exist even at 1000K for very high strain rates, e.g. 8000/s. While the dislocation motion is still the main deformation mechanism for plastic flow, the experimental results suggest that dynamic strain aging should be taken into account, as well as the effect of deformation twinning.},

Twinning was identified to significantly contribute to deformation up to reductions of about 50\%. Based on initial texture of the material investigated and twinning modes available in hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures, the measured texture evolution can be interpreted in terms of (i) compressive twinning (\{11¯22\}〈11¯2¯3〉) within the two dominant initial texture components B (\{0001\}〈10¯10〉±40°TD) and E (\{0001\}〈11¯20〉±40°TD) and (ii) followed by tensile twinning (\{10¯12\}〈10¯1¯1〉) in the then-favorably reoriented twinned part. Reduction of grain size at high deformation inhibits further twinning and results in a stable texture evolution driven exclusively by dislocation slip. During cold rolling, the crystals of the initial texture component B first rotate to orientation M (\{01¯10\}〈2¯1¯12〉) by compressive twinning (primary), and then orientation M rotates to orientation D (\{0001\}〈11¯20〉) by tensile twinning (secondary). Meanwhile, the crystals of the initial component E first rotate to the orientation M′ (\{14¯53\}〈6¯5¯13〉) by compressive twinning (primary), and then orientation M′ rotates to the orientation A (\{0001\}〈10¯10〉) by tensile twinning (secondary). At higher deformation level, twinning was significantly depressed by strongly refined grain size, which resulted in the elimination of the transient texture components caused by slip. These results are useful for the prediction and control of the texture in titanium.},

The as-received plates were subjected to cold rolling with thickness reductions of 33\% and 66\%. Electron back-scatter diffraction and tensile tests were performed to reveal the texture and mechanical properties, respectively. Results showed that a bimodal texture was featured in the as-received plate and the texture was a fiber that spread from {\textless}101‾0{\textgreater} to {\textless}112‾0{\textgreater}. After cold rolling and annealing, a fiber with a continuous distribution from {\textless}101‾0{\textgreater} to {\textless}112‾0{\textgreater} and a fiber with a maximum at the {\textless}112‾0{\textgreater} position were present in the plates with thickness reductions of 33\% and 66\%. Besides, the existence of \{0001\} basal fiber was noticed, indicating more basal poles oriented toward the normal direction. Tensile tests showed that the recrystallized plate with 66\% thickness reduction was more ductile and less strong than that with 33\% reduction. Meanwhile, tensile properties were sensitive to strain rate, loading direction and thickness reduction. Moreover, the relationship between texture development and yield strength was discussed based on Schmid theory. Calculated results indicated that prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip was the predominant deformation mode and its Schmid factor values under different loading directions contributed to the anisotropy of yield strength. Due to the texture development during cold rolling and annealing, the averaged SF values for prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip changed with the increased thickness reduction, resulting in the variation of yield strength.},

The experiments performed are uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression in-plane at 15° angles to the rolling direction (RD), and in the normal direction (ND), as well as plane-strain tension (PST) at 15° angles to the RD of the plate. The uniaxial tension and compression tests involve standard specimen geometries, except for the one in the ND, which required the creation of a custom, miniature tensile specimen. The PST specimen is a custom geometry to impose a constraint in the transverse direction, giving rise to the plane-strain condition. A procedure using finite element analysis is described to determine the axial stress in a PST test. The experiments reveal the deformation-induced anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry of CP-Ti. The material strength is found to increase going from RD to transverse direction (TD) to ND. The experiments are then used to calibrate four constitutive models of increasing complexity: von Mises, Hill '48, KYL '12 and CPB '06. The calibrated models along with the experimental information are shown using three alternative approaches: biaxial tension-compression plane, Haigh-Westergaard or π-plane, and the one recently introduced by (Korkolis et al., 2017) that allows representation of stress states where the full stress tensor is active. Furthermore, the test results from off-axis experiments, not used in the calibration, are used to examine the performance of each model. The best performance in predicting the experiments was exhibited by the KYL '12 and CPB '06 models. It is expected that this improved understanding and representation of the plastic behavior of CP-Ti can lead to improved material models and numerical simulations of manufacturing and service.},

The results show that the yield plateau phenomenon is a result of dislocation behaviors controlled by grain size and thus only exists within a given range of mean grain size. α grain boundaries are the main dislocation multiplication sources of commercially pure titanium. Fine-grained microstructure could offer numerous dislocation multiplication locations during deformation. Once the applied stress is above the yielding strength, dislocations multiply rapidly and the mobile dislocation density is high. To retrieve the imposed strain rate, the mean dislocation velocity is bound to be low. Therefore, it takes time for them to interact with each other. As a result, the movement of dislocations is hardly blocked and the deformation could continue at a nearly constant applied stress. Consequently, the so-called yield plateau behavior presents in the tensile curves. The disappearance of yield plateau phenomenon in coarse-grained and ultrafine-grained microstructures is attributed to the quick realization of the mutual interactions among dislocations at the initial stage of tensile test.},

	abstract = {The PLEIADES software environment is devoted to the thermomechanical simulation of nuclear fuel elements behaviour under irradiation. This platform is co-developed in the framework of a research cooperative program between Électricité de France (EDF), AREVA and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the platform, one of the PLEAIADES’s main challenge is to propose a unified software environment for capitalisation of material knowledge coming from research and development programs on various nuclear systems. This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a code generator based on C++  (Stroustrup and Eberhardt, 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was recently released under the GPL open-source licence and is available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/. The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language considered. In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities, a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour, cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the Code\_Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour implementations written in fortran natively available in this solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up within the PLEIADES platform is briefly discussed. A material database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification workflow. We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a simple FFC single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and viscoplasticity.},

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) simulations have been conducted on large grain aggregates to simulate the in-reactor behavior of recrystallized Zircaloy-4 tubes. Original constitutive equations have been proposed to account, at the microscopic scale, for thermal creep, irradiation creep and irradiation induced growth. The evolution of irradiation defects with dose is taken into account, especially to deduce the local growth strain. A good description of the in-reactor behavior is obtained with irradiation defects evolution consistent with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observations. For the first time a quantitative relationship between irradiation defects observed by TEM and the growth strain is deduced. Furthermore, the simulations are compared with self-consistent polycrystalline model and with the lower-bound model. These simulations show the importance of using an accurate polycrystalline model and taking into account the local creep behavior to predict the growth strain from the knowledge of the irradiation defect evolution.},

Several loading conditions are examined: uniaxial tension/compression and simple shear tests along different orientations with respect to the rolling direction. The main goal is to precisely determine the critical shear stresses and the activated slip systems at moderate strains (up ≈45\% true strain). The observed anisotropic behaviour of α-Ti is explained by the influence of the loading orientation on the activation of different families of slip systems and subsequent texture evolution. The observed behaviours (mechanical data and crystallographic textures) are compared with some predictions performed with a viscoplastic affine self-consistent model in which a dislocation-based hardening law is introduced. The experimental data involved in the identification and the validation of material parameters take into account both stress–strain responses for different loading conditions and the texture evolutions. It is shown that the model predictions in terms of macroscopic stress–strain curves, texture evolution and slip activities are in good agreement with experimental data. The predicted Lankford coefficients are however, less satisfactory. This is explained by the high sensitivity of these coefficients to small variations of texture and especially to the reduction of the sharpness of the texture. Moreover, the limits of the identification of the critical shear stresses from the sole macroscopic response are clearly highlighted. The experimental data base should be enlarged in order to reduce the number of possible scenarios (i.e. combination of activated slip systems) that describe the macroscopic response.},

	abstract = {This work combined theoretical calculation with experimental characterization to methodically study the anisotropy mechanism and evolution of the plastic behavior of pure titanium. Initially, a constant-strain uniaxial tensile test was used to measure the anisotropy of the yield behavior along the rolling direction (RD) and transverse direction (TD). Subsequently, the information of crystal orientation both before and after deformation was statistically characterized using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Ultimately, the main deformation mechanism was determined by combining Schmid law with an analysis of the variation of SF values of each deformation mode with the angular relationship between the loading axis and the grain’s c-axis. The findings demonstrate that, for each slip system, the variation trend and value of the SF are influenced by the angle formed by the loading axis and the grain’s c- and a-axes. The primary result of dislocation slip activation is the change of the tilt angle of the grain c-axis from ND to TD, but this has little effect on the tilt angle of the grain c-axis from ND to RD. Prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip dominates the tensile deformation along the RD. Pyramidal {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip and pyramidal {\textless}c+a{\textgreater} slip will be activated during the subsequent hardening, whereas basal {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip is difficult to activate. The prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip in the soft-oriented grain will be preferentially activated during the tensile deformation along the TD, and the prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip and pyramidal {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip will become the dominant deformation modes during the subsequent hardening. Some soft-oriented grains could activate basal {\textless}a{\textgreater} slip and pyramidal {\textless}c+a{\textgreater} slip, but dislocation slip is restricted and coordinated by \{10-12\}ET.},

A dislocation density-based crystal plasticity finite element method is used to study the associated mechanisms. The simulation accurately reproduces the experimental results on stress–strain curves and strain hardening rate. The relationship between relative activities in different slip systems and anisotropic plastic deformation is established. It is revealed that in the tensile deformation, prismatic slip dominates plastic deformation in the RD, while both prismatic slip and basal slip dominate plastic deformation in the TD. The difference in the dominant slip modes leads to a lower yield stress and a higher strain hardening rate in the RD. Furthermore, the stress and strain distributions in the tensile direction are also statistically analyzed. It is found that a certain proportion of hard grains results in more severe stress concentration and lower uniform elongation in the TD specimen compared with the RD specimen. In addition, the strain rate sensitivity of the yield stress is investigated. It is shown that Zircaloy-4 alloy has almost the same yield anisotropy (TD {\textgreater} RD in terms of the yield stress) at different strain rates in the RD and TD.},

Herein, we investigated all possible slip modes in pure Ti and the effects of Al and V solutes as typical additive elements on the dislocation motion in α-Ti alloys using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The stacking fault (SF) energy calculations indicated that both Al and V solutes reduce the SF energy in the basal plane. In contrast, Al solute increases the SF energy in the prismatic plane, making the slip motion in different planes more comparable. DFT calculations were subsequently carried out to simulate dislocation core structures. The energy landscape of the transition between all possible dislocation core structures and the barriers for dislocation glide in various slip planes clarified the nature of dislocation motion in pure Ti; i) the energy of prismatic core is higher than the most stable pyramidal core, and thereby dislocations need to overcome the energy barrier of the cross-slip (22.8 meV/b) when they move in the prismatic plane, ii) the energy difference between the prismatic and basal cores is higher (127 meV/b), that indicates the basal slip does not activate, iii) however, the Peierls barrier for motion in the basal plane is not as high (16 meV/b) once the dislocation exists stably in the basal plane. Direct calculations for the dislocation core around solutes revealed that both Al and V solutes facilitate dislocation motion in the basal plane by reducing the energy difference between the prismatic and basal cores. Thus, the effect of solutes characterizes the difference in the deformation mode of pure Ti and α-Ti alloys.},

The procedure makes use of multiple input images: sets of regular polarized micrographs or—where possible—orientation/misorientation images. On each image of a given input set, only the most significant grain boundaries are detected and by combining those, a single grain boundary map is obtained. Image models and criteria for grain boundary identification are discussed briefly. The principal aim of the LGB method is to facilitate the production of large grain boundary maps (containing several thousand cross-sectional areas) to provide statistically valid samples for grain size analysis. A section of Black Hills quartzite was used to test the LGB method. Five different input sets were prepared and used for automatic LGB analysis. One set was additionally used for an interactive analysis and for a manual tracing. From all seven grain boundary maps, the 2- and 3-D grain size distributions were calculated.

To this end, generic composite voxel models have been formulated and implemented, allowing to extend the approach to any type of constitutive behavior in the future. In particular, we show that laminate composite voxels are particularly well suited to improve standard FFT-based solvers in this context, and enable to run polycrystalline simulations accurately accounting for slip bands whose width is two orders of magnitude below the grain size. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we apply it to an idealized material designed to approximate basal channeling in irradiated textured Zr alloys. Varying the width and the spacing of the modeled slip bands, we show that it allows to capture the increase of grain boundary normal stress concentrations or the enhanced Bauschinger effect induced by an increased localization of plastic slip.},

Electron back-scatter diffraction maps are used to link the deformation to the microstructure. Deformation occurs in domains, in which most of the plastic strain originates from the activation of a single slip system with high resolved shear stress. Within domains, slip is localized in lamellar regions that increase in number with strain. The deformation incompatibility between grains that develops as a consequence of this single crystal like behaviour is accommodated by either a gradient in slip intensity and the consequent development of lattice curvature at the grain boundary or the activation of an additional high stressed slip system and the consequent formation of a complementary deformation domain within the grain. In many cases, however, lattice curvature across grain boundaries is small because the deformation domains in neighbouring grains are compatible. The implications of these observations for continuum crystal plasticity modelling are discussed.},

Its inability to predict size-dependent effects at this length scale has motivated the use of higher-order gradients to model material behavior at the micron level. The physical motivation behind the use of strain gradients has been based on the framework of geometrically-necessary dislocations (GNDs). A new but equivalent definition for Nye's dislocation tensor, a measure of GND density, is proposed, based on the integrated properties of dislocation lines within a volume. A discrete form of the definition is applied to redundant crystal systems, and methods for characterizing the dislocation tensor with realizable crystallographic dislocations are presented. From these methods and the new definition of the dislocation tensor, two types of three-dimensional dislocation structures are found: open periodic networks which have long-range geometric consequences, and closed three-dimensional dislocation structures which self-terminate, having no geometric consequence. The implications of these structures on the presence of GNDs in polycrystalline materials lead to the introduction of a Nye factor relating geometrically-necessary dislocation density to plastic strain gradients.},

Here we show that very large grains ({\textgreater}0.5 mm) can be generated systematically during controlled deformation and subsequent heat treatments. We observe that the texture of these grains is controlled either by twinning or prior texture, depending on the strain path. Their nucleation, growth and texture can be controlled through strain path and deformation level. This work provides detailed understanding of the formation of these very large grains in Zircaloy-4, and also opens up opportunities for large single crystal fabrication for mm scale mechanical testing.},

	abstract = {A specimen of Ti–4Al deformed in-situ to about 0.7\% compressive strain using neutron diffraction, and showing early stages of twinning, has been investigated in 3D using synchrotron X-ray diffraction contrast tomography (DCT). A cylindrical volume of 900 μm × 400 μm diameter was observed using DCT, containing about 400 grains of which almost 60 grains were identified to have twinned predominantly by \{101¯2\} 〈1¯011〉 011 tensile twinning. To consider possible twin nucleation criteria, non-twinned grains of similar orientation to the twinned grains were compared against the family of twinned grains. Such comparison highlights that the twinned grain family has a grain size distribution shifted to a higher mean value than the corresponding family of grains that has not twinned. An initial neighbourhood analysis did not reveal any significant differences of the two grain families. However, complex twin chains and clusters were identified forming a slightly imperfect network demonstrating the importance of the 3D analysis. Analysis of the parent grain orientations within those chains/clusters using the Luster-Morris parameter revealed a significantly higher propensity of prismatic 〈a〉 slip transfer compared to the neighbourhood of the non-twinned grain family while no difference was observed for the likelihood of twin shear transfer. The findings suggest that grain chains/clusters with high ability of prismatic 〈a〉 slip activity and slip transfer does promote formation and clustering of twins, which is likely associated with the build up of tensile intergranular strain along the 〈c〉 axis perpendicular to the loading direction recently suggested by crystal plasticity modelling.},

The surface elastic strain field was integrated to calculate in-plane and out-of-plane surface displacements. This allowed the elastic fields to be parameterised in a finite element analysis, which used the displacement field as the boundary conditions, to obtain the potential strain energy release rate (J-integral) and three-dimensional stress intensity factors (KI,II,III). This new analysis method is demonstrated by examining the elastic fields around the tip of an incipient slip band, an array of slip bands and the loading of a slip band. Direct measurement of the stress tensor in the grain identified the active slip systems with the highest Schmid factor. The stress intensity factors ahead of the slip band, measured under load, were directly affected by the magnitude of loading and the inclination angle of the slip band to the observed surface.},

	abstract = {Single phase α-titanium shows anomalous warm deformation behaviour. As the temperature increases, ductility increases in uniaxial tension and decreases in biaxial stretching. Previously, this behaviour was attributed to an increase in strain rate sensitivity and a decrease in twinning activity with temperature. In this study, we show that it can instead be explained by an increase in slip anisotropy with temperature. Grade 2 CP-Ti sheet was tested in uniaxial tension at 20 °C and 300 °C to determine ductility, work hardening behaviour and the coefficient of plastic anisotropy (R-value). The increase in uniaxial ductility with temperature was found to be a consequence of an increasing rate of saturation work hardening with temperature. In the absence of significant twinning, this unexpected work hardening behaviour was attributed to an increase in slip anisotropy with temperature. This hypothesis was supported by crystal plasticity finite element modelling, which can also predict the observed increase in surface roughness with temperature. The increase in anisotropy leads to higher strain localization which, coupled with the increasing work hardening rate helps explain why biaxial ductility decreases with increasing temperature. In addition to explaining the limitations in warm forming of Ti, understanding the origins of these effects contributes to our general understanding of the deformation of other hexagonal metals like Zr and Mg.},

The results show that DY is caused by dislocation slip in the primary α (αp) phase excited by the accumulation of dislocations at the αp/β phase interface. When the V content increases, the content of β phase increases from 17 to 53.4\% and the aspect ratio of αp phase decreases from 10.1 to 4.3. The difference of hardness and Young's modulus between β and αp phases increases from 0.08 to 1.39 GPa and 11.18 to 25.72 GPa, respectively.

The stress relaxation tests were performed by interrupting the tensile tests at regular strain intervals of 5\% in the plastic region of the tensile curve and compared to the monotonic tensile tests at different strain rates ranging from 10-4 to 10-1s-1. To understand the effect of anisotropy, samples were taken along 0° and 90° to rolling direction (RD) for both the alloys. Improvement in ductility of different levels at all the strain rates was observed in both the alloys when stress relaxation steps were introduced as compared to monotonic tests. However there is not much change in the flow stress as well as in strain hardening behaviour of the alloys. The true stress-true strain curves of Grade 4 samples taken in 90° to RD exhibited discontinuous yielding phenomenon after the yield point, which is termed as a yield-point elongation (YPE). The improvement in ductility of the Cp-Ti alloys can be linked to recovery process occurring during the stress relaxation steps which resulted in the improvement in ductility after repeated interrupted tensile tests.

	abstract = {Starting from the rate independent theory of the single crystal plasticity (Schmid law), one here tries to both give the most realistic description of the concept of intracrystalline latent hardening—or hardening anisotropy—through the analysis, at the microstructural scale of the dislocation densities, of various and complementary experimental data, and to underline the excessive restriction introduced by the classical assumption of pure strain hardening in the determination of the most general single crystal hardening variation law for the wider range of loading processes. These developments about the microstructural features of single crystal hardening, involving mobile and nonmobile dislocation density evolutions (multiplications) and interactions, are correlated at the macroscopic scale of the slip systems with a strain and load process and orientation hardening law which is shown on few examples to give a better fit with observed behaviour than pure strain hardening. A third part shows that, even starting from a rate dependent assumption for the single crystal plastic flow, the present analysis of latent hardening remains basically unchanged. It shows too that the load process and orientation effect on hardening, which is implicitly present in such approaches although introduced according to specific assumptions on the correlations between slips and dislocation densities, is one of the most significant features in the single crystals hardening evolution during plastic deformation, whatever the theoretical frame is chosen.
Résumé
Partant de la théorie de la plasticité d'un monocristal indépendante de la vitesse (loi de Schmid), nous essayons ici de donner la description la plus réaliste possible du concept de durcissement latent intracristallin—ou anisotropie de durcissement—par l'analyse, à l'échelle microstructurale des densités de dislocations, de résultats expérimentaux divers et complémentaires, et de souligner la très grande restriction imposée par l'hypothèse classique d'un écrouissage pur par la déformation dans la détermination de la loi de variation du durcissement d'un monocristal la plus générale pour une très large gamme de mécanismes de charge. Nous relions ces développements concernant les traits microstructuraux du durcissement monocristallin, mettant en jeu des évolutions (multiplication) de la densité de dislocations mobiles et non mobiles, et leurs interactions, à l'échelle macroscopique des systèmes de glissement, avec une la d'écrovissage par le déformation, le chargement et l'orientation dont on montre sur quelques exemples qu'elle donne un meilleur accord avec le comportement observé qu'un durcissement de déformation pur. Dans une troisième partie, nous montrons que, même en partant de l'hypothèse d'un écoulement plastique monocristallin dépendant de la vitesse, notre analyse du durcissement latent reste fondamentalement inchangée. Nous montrons également que l'effet du mécanisme de mise en charge et de l'orientation sur le durcissement, qui est implicitement présent dans de telles approches bien qu'il soit introduit selon des hypothèses spécifiques sur les corrélations entre les glissements et les densités de dislocations, est un des traits les plus caractéristiques de l'évolution du durcissement des mono cristaux au cours de la déformation plastique, quelque soit le cadre théorique choisi.
Zusammenfassung
Ausgehend von der Raten-unabhängigen Theorie der Einkristallplastizität (Schmidtsches Gesetz) wird versucht, eine möglichst realistische Beschreibung des Konzeptes der intrakristallinen latenten Verfestigung-oder der Verfestigungsanisotropie-zu geben, Hierzu werden die Versetzungsdichten und die verschiedenen sich ergänzenden Ergebnisse analysiert. Auβerdem wirddie auβergewöhnliche Einschränkung deutlich gemacht, die mit der klassischen Annahme einer reinen Dehnungsverfestigung eingeführt wird, wenn das allgemeinste Gesetz für die Veränderung der Einkristallverfestigung für einen weiten Bereich von Belastungsprozessen bestimmt werden soll. Die Entwicklung der mikrostrukturellen Eigenschaften der Einkristallverfestigung, welche die Entwicklung der beweglichen und nicht beweglichen Versetzungsdichte (Multiplikation) und auch Wechselwirkungen einschlieβt, werden auf der makroskopischen Ebene der Gleitsysteme mit einem Dehnungs-und Lastprozeβ und einem Verfestigungsgesetz korreliert. Dieses Gesetz erlaubt-wie mit einigen wenigen Beispielen gezeigt wird-eine bessere Anpassung an das beobachtete Verhalten wie bei der reinen Dehnungsverfestigung. Im dritten Teil wird gezeigt, daβ diese Analyse im wesentlichen gleich bleibt, auch wenn von einer Geschwindigkeitsabhängigkeit des Einkristallflieβens ausgegangen wird. Auβerdem wird gezeigt, daβ der Lastprozeβ und der Orientierungseinflub auf die Verfestigung, welche implizit bei solchen Näherungen auch bei der Einführung durch spezielle Annahmen über den Zusammenhang zwischen Gleitung und Versetzungsdichten vorhanden ist, die herausragendsten Eigenschaften in der Entwicklung der Einkristallverfestigung sind, unabhängig vom theoretischen Ansatz.},

Here, the three-stage work hardening and plastic strain recovery (“springback”) in a cold-rolled, α-phase commercially pure titanium is examined. Interrupted standard tensile tests with in situ x-ray diffraction and quasi-in situ electron backscatter diffraction show that twinning plays a minor role in both of these phenomena. The experiments give evidence that the observed work hardening plateau is the result of an abrupt activation and multiplication of 〈c+a〉 slip and a subsequent redistribution of load between grain families. The springback can be attributed to inelastic backwards motion and annihilation of dislocations, driven by backstresses from dislocation-based hardening during loading. The peak broadening behavior, observed by x-ray diffraction, suggests that the internal stress state is highest in the rolling direction, resulting in consistently higher springback magnitude along this direction.

Twins are often considered to be responsible for various peculiar features of plastic flow, such as compression–tension anisotropy, a high work hardening rate, or a particular three-stage shape of deformation curves observed not only for single crystals but also for polycrystals. However, the role of twins remains a matter of debate. Moreover, most of the experimental results have been obtained in compression conditions and it is not clear whether the same features appear in other testing conditions. In the present work, tensile tests were performed on commercially pure α-Ti samples cut along the rolling and the transverse direction, and yielded several unexpected results. In particular, the work hardening rate was found to be lower in the latter case, although the EBSD measurements revealed a larger twin volume fraction in such samples. Besides, the two kinds of specimens showed an opposite sign of the strain-rate effect on the tendency to the three-stage work hardening. The possible role of twinning, dislocation glide, and aging of dislocations on the anisotropy of mechanical behavior of titanium is discussed. A mechanism based on the consideration of the dislocation glide anisotropy is suggested.},

	abstract = {Several additive manufacturing (AM) methods use powder feed materials. Selective laser sintering is an example of a versatile AM method, using feed material in powder form, capable of producing polymer and metallic parts. In the variations of this technique, a laser spot or an electron beam is used to locally sinter or melt a packed powder bed. After the completion of sintering on each layer, further powder is added on top of the existing bed so that the next layer may be joined. A major challenge in this method is controlling the porosity of the powder bed so that the final part has uniform and maximum density. Uniformity in the packing of bed from one layer to the other is important for optimizing the processing parameters. This review is focused on considering the packing characteristics of polydisperse hard particle beds and the determination of the expected density achievable for a given particle size and shape distribution. Models are presented for discrete mixtures as well as continuous distributions. The effect of the initial configuration of a particle bed on its ability to form a highly dense packing is also discussed. Blending of different particle sizes and shapes can be used to substantially increase the packing density, but can also lead to separation or segregation of the bed. Through appropriate control of the particle shape and use of wide distributions, packing densities close to 100 \% can theoretically be achieved, but practicality and various effects that appear at small size scales prevent from achieving such high packing densities. Recent advancements have reduced the dependence of AM part quality on the density of the packed particle bed but the packing is still important for considerations such as thermal conductivity of the bed and absorption of laser power in the bed. Improved knowledge of packed bed characteristics can be helpful in developing AM methods for novel material systems.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous strain was analyzed in polycrystalline, commercial-purity titanium using many experimental techniques that provide information about microstructure, dislocation arrangement, grain orientation, orientation gradients, surface topography, and local strain gradients. The recrystallized microstructure with 50–200 µm grains was extensively characterized before and after deformation using 4-point bending to strains between 2\% and 15\%. Extremely heterogeneous deformation occurred along some grain boundaries, leading to orientation gradients exceeding 10° over 10–20 µm. Patches of highly characterized micro-structure were modeled using crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) analysis to simulate the deformation to evaluate the ability of the CPFE model to capture local deformation processes. Damage nucleation events were identified that are associated with twin interactions with grain boundaries. Progress toward identifying fracture initiation criteria based upon slip and twin interactions with grain boundaries is illustrated with related CPFE simulations of deformation in a TiAl alloy.},

Inspired by the medium-Mn steel microstructure, a three-dimensional micromechanical modeling approach is therefore proposed in the present work, embedding the thin RA films explicitly into the hierarchical lath martensite structure. This enables systematic studies of the effect of RA film thickness and volume fraction on the local stresses and strains as well as their partitioning within the microstructure. The investigations reveal that with shrinking RA volume fraction, both stress and especially strain heterogeneity in the thin-film RA intensifies. In the martensite blocks, stress and strain heterogeneity also intensifies, although stresses are generally more heterogeneously, and strains much more homogeneously, distributed than in RA. The results underline the key role of RA with thin-film morphology for further optimizing AHSS microstructures.},

Sphero-conical nanoindentation was performed for a number of different crystallographic orientations. The grain size was much larger than the size of the indents to ensure quasi-single-crystal indentation. The hexagonal c-axis was determined to be the hardest direction. Surface topographies of several indents were measured by atomic force microscopy. Analysis of the indent surfaces, following Zambaldi and Raabe (Acta Mater. 58(9), 3516–3530), revealed the orientation-dependent pileup behavior of α-titanium during axisymmetric indentation. Corresponding crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations predicted the pileup patterns with good accuracy. The constitutive parameters of the CPFE model were identified by a nonlinear optimization procedure, and reproducibly converged toward easy activation of prismatic glide systems.

To this end, discrete dislocation dynamics simulations are used to (1) extract latent hardening parameters coupling different slip systems, and to (2) assess the validity of two existing constitutive models linking slip system strength to dislocation densities on all slip systems. As hexagonal materials deform via activation of different slip modes, each with different mobilities and lattice friction stress, the effects of the latter on latent hardening evolution are also investigated. It is found that the multi-slip formulation proposed by Franciosi and Zaoui gives accurate predictions when multiple interactions are involved while the formulation suggested by Lavrentev and Pokhil systematically overestimates the flow stress. Similar to FCC materials, it is also found that collinear interactions potentially contribute the most to latent hardening. Basal/pyramidal 〈c+a〉 interactions are found to be very strong, while interactions involving second-order pyramidal 〈c+a〉 primary dislocations appear to be the weakest ones. Finally, the latent hardening parameters, extracted from the discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, are used in polycrystal simulations and the impact of finely accounting for latent hardening on predictions of the macroscopic anisotropic response is shown to be of significant importance.},

The phase transition from ω to β or from α to β  becomes easier for Fe-doped Ti compared to pure titanium.

However, the addition of Fe to Ti causes segregation issues during solidification, which can be avoided by diffusion-driven solid-state alloying. To predict the diffusion kinetics, the interaction mobility parameters of Ti and Fe in the disordered BCC phase of Ti are necessary. In this work, these parameters are optimised based on new experimental data from Ti-Fe diffusion couples produced by the Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST). Diffusion couples were held at 1173K and 1273K for one hour. High-resolution Fe concentration profiles are obtained from Electron Probe Micro Analyser (EPMA).

By taking explicitly into account the symmetry of the deformation systems present in the crystal, a systematic description of the SCYS is obtained. The ca ratio and the critical stresses associated with slip and twinning systems are treated as parameters in the equations that describe the SCYS: this allows for a fully topological characterization of the yield surface. Tables for the vertex coordinates as a function of these parameters are given. As an application of the method, the SCYS of materials exhibiting the deformation modes typical of Zr alloys is derived and analyzed, and used for the calculation of textured Zircaloy-2 yield loci. The case of materials exhibiting basal slip is addressed in an Appendix: a simple solution is obtained for the limit of very easy basal slip.
Résumé
Nous proposons une approche générale pour calculer la surface de la limite élastique de monocristaux (SLEM) de matériaux hexagonaux compacts (h.c.), qui est nécessaire pour décrire la déformation plastique des polycristaux. En tenant explicitement compte de la symétrie des systèmes de déformation présents dans le cristal, nous obtenons une description systématique de la SLEM. Le rapport ca et les contraintes critiques associées aux systèmes de glissement et de maciage sont traités comme des paramètres des équations décrivant la SLEM: ceci permet une caractérisation topologique complète de la surface de la limite élastique. Nous présentons des tables pour les coordonnées des sommets en fonction de ces paramètres. En application de cette méthode, nous obtenons et nous analysons les SLEM de matériaux présentant les modes de déformation caractéristiques des alliages de Zr et nous les utilisons pour calculer le lieu de la limite élastique du Zircalloy-2 texturé. Nous nous occupons dans un appendice du cas des matériaux présentant le glissement basai; nous obtenons une solution simple dans la limite d'un glissement basal très facile.
Zusammenfassung
Zur Berechnung der Flieβfläche von Einkristallen mit hexagonal dichtester Packung wird ein allgemeines Verfahren vorgeschlagen. Solche Berechnungen sind nötig, um das plastische Verhalten von Vielkristallen beschreiben zu können. Die Flieβfläche kann systematisch beschrieben werden, wenn die Symmetrie der in dem Kristall vorhandenen Verformungssysteme explizit berücksichtigt wird. Das ca-Verhältnis und die mit den Gleit- und Zwillingssystemen zusammenhängenden kritischen Spannungen gehen als Parameter in die Gleichungen für die Flieβfläche ein. Dadurch kann die Flieβfläche topologisch vollständig charakterisiert werden. Tabellen werden für die Vertexkoordinaten in Abhängigkeit von diesen Parametern angegeben. Als eine Anwendung wird die Flieβoberfläche für Werkstoffe, die das Verformungsverhalten von Zr aufweisen, abgeleitet und analysiert. Die Ergebnisse werden zur Berechnung der Flieβorte in texturbehaftetem Zircaloy-2 benutzt. Der Fall von Werkstoffen mit Basisgleitung wird in einem Anhang behandelt; für den Grenzfall sehr leichter Basisgleitung ergibt sich eine einfache Lösung.},

It is observed that the hardness of the grains close to basal orientation is higher compared to non-basal orientations.

ET nucleate till ε=0.10 and broadens to consume almost the entire microstructure up to ε=0.22. The ET reorient the microstructure to a geometrically hard orientation with c-axis ∼∥ to compression direction (CD) escalating the Taylor factor (M). The ET leads to sigmoidal flow behavior from ε=0.06 to 0.17, increasing SHR in stage II. The ET domains majorly deform by pyramidal {\textless}c+a{\textgreater} and basal slips, though having high shear strength, and produce \{112¯7\}−\{101¯7\} fiber texture from ε=0.1 to 0.69. Beyond ε=0.11, \{112¯2\}{\textless}112¯3¯{\textgreater} contraction twins (CT) also evolve inside ET-domains, consuming ∼0.29 of its fraction. The CT reorient the ET domains to a softer \{112¯1\}−\{112¯2\} fiber texture with a low M.

The analyses show that the orientation and curvature of the GB influence the local stress fields at the GBs, and consequently, the slip/twin transmission across the boundary. In addition to host grain properties, neighboring grain properties, such as active slip systems and instances of heterogeneity like slip bands and twins, heavily affect the deformation mechanisms in each grain. Finally, the applicability of geometric factors to predict the transmission in the experimentally observed co-located pairs is discussed.

Such a deformation scheme corresponds to the operation of glide on (0001) in polycrystalline ice used in the physical deformation experiments. The results show that lattice rotation is primarily controlled by the bulk deformation kinematics in both the polycrystalline aggregates and the single crystals. In the single crystals the lattice rotation is entirely consistent with the vorticity of the bulk deformation kinematics, whereas in the polycrystalline aggregates extensive grain interactions significantly modify the local lattice rotations and may even lead to the lattice planes of individual grains rotating in an opposite sense to that of the bulk deformation. These results can reasonably explain the development of crystallographic preferred orientations widely reported in the literature.},

For low to intermediate deformation up to 40\% in thickness reduction, the external strain was accommodated by slip and deformation twinning. In this stage, both compressive (\{1 1 2¯ 2\}〈1 1 2¯ 3¯〉) and tensile (\{1 0 1¯ 2\}〈1 0 1¯ 1¯〉) twins, as well as, secondary twins and tertiary twins were activated in the grains of favorable orientation, and this resulted in a heterogeneous microstructure in which grains were refined in local areas. For heavy deformation, between 60 and 90\%, slip overrode twinning and shear bands developed. The crystal texture of deformed specimens was weakened by twinning but was strengthened by slip, resulting in a split-basal texture in heavily deformed specimens.},

The effect of the interaction among the regions was incorporated into SOF. A microstructural map of α-titanium (α-Ti) was obtained by the electron backscatter diffraction patterns. Several spatial distributions of SOF were calculated based on the map by changing the interaction range among the regions. The distributions were compared with those of the strains obtained by the crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) analysis. Good agreement between the distributions was found near the macroscopic yield point when the interaction range was appropriate, although some significant differences between the distributions were also noticed after the yielding point. The prediction accuracy by SOF was higher than that by SF and NSF. The reasons for the high accuracy revealed by the SOF analysis and the differences between the distributions indicated by the CPFE analysis were also investigated.},

At regions surrounding grain boundaries, the majority of activated dislocation slip traces were found to form in pairs across grain boundary, and the basal-to-basal (B-B) slip pair is the dominant type. Strain accommodation around the grain boundary interfaces is affected by both Schmid factor in the adjacent grains and the m’ value between these main slip systems. A mk value was proposed in this paper as the maximum value of the product of the Schmid factor and the m’ value of the adjacent grains to measure strain accommodation around the grain boundary interface, where a higher mk value would mean a larger local strain. It is suggested that the overall ductility of a Mg alloy could be evaluated by measuring its average mk value. As an evidence, the Mg-Gd-Y alloy tubes with higher mk value generally show higher elongations during tensile tests in this study.},

Improving the understanding of grain–grain interactions has important consequences for in-service performance limits. Three-dimensional synchrotron X-ray diffraction was used to study the evolution of grain-resolved stresses over many contiguous grains in Zr and Ti polycrystals deformed in situ. In a significant fraction of grains, the stress along the loading axis was found to decrease during tensile plastic flow just beyond the macroscopic yield point; this is in the absence of deformation twinning and is a surprising behaviour. It is shown that this phenomenon is controlled by the crystallographic orientation of the grain and its immediate neighbours, particularly those adjacent along the loading axis.},

	abstract = {The circumferential hydrides normally present in nuclear reactor fuel cladding after reactor exposure may dissolve during drying for dry storage and re-precipitate when cooled under load into a more radial orientation, which could embrittle the fuel cladding. It is necessary to study the rates and conditions under which hydride reorientation may happen in order to assess fuel integrity in dry storage. The objective of this work is to study the effect of applied stress and thermal cycling on the hydride morphology in cold-worked stress-relieved Zircaloy-4 by combining conventional metallography and in situ X-ray diffraction techniques. Metallography is used to study the evolution of hydride morphology after several thermo-mechanical cycles. In situ X-ray diffraction performed at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron provides real-time information on the process of hydride dissolution and precipitation under stress during several thermal cycles. The detailed study of diffracted intensity, peak position and full-width at half-maximum provides information on precipitation kinetics, elastic strains and other characteristics of the hydride precipitation process. The results show that thermo-mechanical cycling significantly increases the radial hydride fraction as well as the hydride length and connectivity. The radial hydrides are observed to precipitate at a lower temperature than circumferential hydrides. Variations in the magnitude and range of hydride strains due to reorientation and cycling have also been observed. These results are discussed in light of existing models and experiments on hydride reorientation. The study of hydride elastic strains during precipitation shows marked differences between circumferential and radial hydrides, which can be used to investigate the reorientation process.},

	abstract = {It is a well known and important problem in the aircraft engine industry that alloy Ti-6242 shows a significant reduction in fatigue life, termed dwell debit, if a stress dwell is included in the fatigue cycle, whereas Ti-6246 does not; the mechanistic explanation for the differing dwell debit of these alloys has remained elusive for decades. In this work, crystal plasticity modelling has been utilised to extract the thermal activation energies for pinned dislocation escape for both Ti alloys based on independent experimental data. This then allows the markedly different cold creep responses of the two alloys to be captured accurately and demonstrates why the observed near-identical rate sensitivity under non-dwell loading is entirely consistent with the dwell behaviour. The activation energies determined are then utilised within a recently developed thermally-activated discrete dislocation plasticity model to predict the strain rate sensitivities of the two alloys associated with nano-indentation into basal and prism planes. It is shown that Ti-6242 experiences a strong crystallographic orientation-dependent rate sensitivity while Ti-6246 does not which is shown to agree with recently published independent measurements; the dependence of rate sensitivity on indentation slip plane is also well captured. The thermally-activated discrete dislocation plasticity model shows that the incorporation of a stress dwell in fatigue loading leads to remarkable stress redistribution from soft to hard grains in the classical cold dwell fatigue rogue grain combination in alloy Ti-6242, but that no such load shedding occurs in alloy Ti-6246. The key property controlling the behaviour is the time constant of the thermal activation process relative to that of the loading. This work provides the first mechanistic basis to explain why alloy Ti-6242 shows a dwell debit but Ti-6246 does not.},

The proposed framework is based on the elasto-viscoplastic (EVP) fast Fourier transform (FFT) formulation presented by Lebensohn et al. (2012) and the rate dependent crystal plasticity framework developed by Asaro and Needleman (1985). In this implementation, the full-field solutions of micromechanical fields are computed on a regular, voxelized representative volume element (RVE) in which either a single or multiple grid points represent a single grain. The Asaro and Needleman (1985) formulation coupled with a semi-explicit, forward gradient time-integration scheme (Peirce et al., 1983) is used to compute local stresses and the FFT-based method is used to find local strain fluctuations at each grid point. The proposed model is calibrated using experimental uniaxial tensile test results of aluminum alloy (AA) 5754 sheet and then used to predict texture evolution and stress-strain response for balanced biaxial tension and plane-strain tension along rolling (RD) and transverse (TD) directions. The predicted stress-strain and texture results show a good agreement with experimental measurements. The CPU time required by the proposed model is compared with the original EVP-FFT model for two separate cases and the proposed model showed significant improvement in computation time (approximately 100 times faster).},

A simple case of a periodic laminate made of two fcc crystals with different plastic properties is first used to assess the soundness and numerical stability of the proposed algorithm and to study the influence of different model parameters on the predictions of the non-local model. Different behaviors at grain boundaries are explored, and the one consistent with the micro-clamped condition gives the most pronounced size effect.

Texture measurements indicate that the development of texture in titanium is rapid. At strains around 20\% a split rolling direction texture forms. Further deformation from 20\% to 40\% leads to a texture transition from split rolling direction to split transverse direction. Short-term annealing of samples rolled to a strain of 40\% causes texture transition from split transverse direction to split rolling direction. It also brings about recrystallization within the primary twins and an overall reduction in the density of dislocations.

	abstract = {Excessive interstitial oxygen (O) contamination, usually causing a dramatic loss of ductility, remains a longstanding challenge for titanium (Ti) and its alloys. Here, we propose to solve this critical problem by adding a minor CaC2 oxygen-scavenger via a simple powder metallurgy (PM) pressureless sintering approach. It is found that the surface oxide layer of hydride-dehydride (HDH) Ti powder begins to dissolve into the Ti matrix between 700 °C and 800 °C during the PM sintering process. The incorporation of CaC2 can react with the surface oxide layer (617-676 °C) prior to its active dissolution and form micrometer-sized TiC and nano-sized CaTiO3 particles, significantly refining the α-Ti grains and creating clean and well-bonded interface with Ti matrix. Therefore, the unique oxygen-scavenging effect by CaC2 produces high strength and superior ductility for Ti alloy. Even with an initially high oxygen content (∼4000 ppm), the Ti-0.4 wt.\%CaC2 sample still exhibits a high ultimate tensile strength of 621±25 MPa and superior elongation of 29.3±2.6\%, respectively. These values correspond to an increase of 17.6\% and 301.4\% compared to the as-sintered commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) properties and far exceed the ASTM standard B381 for Grade 4 wrought Ti alloy (550 MPa and 15\%) with the same O content. This work offers a novel method to develop high-strength and superior-ductility Ti materials from much more affordable Ti powder.},

three important variables: orientation; temperature from 25 C to 600 C; and composition for two contrasting alloys, CP-G1 and CP-G4. The experimental data
used to characterise the behaviour and determine the mechanisms causing it were:
textures determined by X-ray diffraction; twin area fractions for individual modes
determined using electron back-scatter diffraction; and lattice strains measured by
neutron diffraction.
A strong effect of the orientation–stress state conditions on the flow curves (flow
stress anisotropy) was found. The propensity for prism hai slip was the dominant
cause of the behaviour – samples that were more favourably oriented for prism hai slip
had lower flow stresses. Twinning was the most significant secondary deformation
mode in the CP-G1 alloy but only had a minor effect on flow stress anisotropy in
most cases. In the CP-G4 alloy twinning generally did not play a significant role
indicating that hc + ai slip modes were significant in this alloy. Differences in the
flow stress anisotropy between the two alloys were found to occur largely in the
elasto-plastic transition and initial period of hardening. Modelling results indicated
that larger relative resolved shear stress values for secondary deformation modes in
the higher purity alloy increased the initial anisotropy.
Decreasing flow stresses with increasing temperature were largely caused by a
decrease in the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) values for slip, but also by a
decrease in the Hall-Petch parameter for slip.
The propagation of twinning was found to be orientation dependent through a
Schmid law in a similar way to slip – it was activated at a CRSS and hardened so
that an increasing resolved shear stress was required for it to continue operating.
The CRSS values determined for the individual twin modes were – 65MPa, 180MPa,
83MPa for \{1012\}, \{1122\} and \{1011\} twinning, respectively. Further, twinning was
found to be temperature insensitive except when the ability to nucleate twins posed
a significant barrier (for \{1011\} twinning). Also, the CRSS for \{1012\} twinning was
clearly shown to increase with decreasing alloy purity.
A thorough method for determining crystal plasticity modelling parameters based
on experimental data was formulated. Additionally, twinning was modelled in a
physically realistic manner influenced by the present findings using the visco-plastic
self-consistent (VPSC) model. In particular: the activity of twinning decreased in a
natural way due to greater difficulty in its operation rather than through an enforced
saturation; and hardening or softening due to changes in orientation and dynamic
Hall-Petch hardening were important. The rigorous modelling procedure gave great
confidence in the key experimental findings.},

	abstract = {The concepts of twinning shears and twinning modes are introduced. The early attempts to predict these features are presented. This is followed by a detailed discussion of the formal theories of Bilby and Crocker and Bevis and Crocker for predicting these elements. Their formalisms are applied to predict twinning modes in single lattice structures, superlattices, hexagonal close packed structure and other double lattice structures. Wherever possible the predicted modes are compared with those observed. The description of fully coherent, rational twin interfaces is presented, and the concepts of elementary, zonal, complementary and partial twinning dislocations are discussed. It is suggested that the irrational K1 twin interfaces may be faceted on the microscopic scale, and these facets may be coherent. Homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of twins are discussed. The growth of twins by the nucleation of twinning dislocations on planes parallel and contiguous to the coherent twin boundary is considered. Various dislocation models proposed for the formation of twins in b.c.c., f.c.c., diamond cubic, zinc-blende and h.c.p. structures are critically reviewed. In some cases the supporting experimental evidence is presented. Additionally, the effects of deformation temperature, imposed strain-rate, alloying and doping, prestrain, precipitates and second phase disperions on deformation twinning are discussed. Mechanistic details regarding the accommodation processes occurring at twins terminating within a crystal, slip-twin, twin-slip and twin-twin intersections are reviewed and are compared with the experimental results. The role of twins in the nucleation of fracture in materials is also considered.},
